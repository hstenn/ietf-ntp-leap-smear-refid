    <abstract>
      <t>
	Leap Seconds are part of UTC.  NTP timestamps are based on POSIX
	timestamps, which require each day to have exactly 86,400 seconds
	per day.  Some applications and environments choose to "smear" leap
	second corrections over a period that can last up to 24 hours' time,
	and implement NTP servers that offer smeared time to clients asking
	them for the time.
      </t>

      <t>Both NTP clients and operators have no current way to tell if an
	NTP server is offering leap-smeared time or not.  This is a problem.
      </t>

      <t>
	This proposal offers a mechanism by which clients (and operators)
	can trivially detect a server that is offering leap-smeared time.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>
	Leap Seconds are applied as needed to UTC in order to keep its time
	of day close to UT1's mean solar time.
      </t>

      <t>
	<xref target="RFC5905">RFC 5905</xref> and earlier versions of NTP
	are the overwhelming method of distributing time on networks.  The
	timescale used by NTP is based on POSIX which, for better or worse,
	ignores any instances where there are not 86,400 seconds per day.
      </t>

      <t>
	Leap Seconds will continue to exist for the foreseeable future, and
	similarly, POSIX can be expected to ignore leap seconds for the
	foreseeable future.
      </t>

      <t>
	Different applications have different requirements for the stability
	of time during the application of a leap second.  Some applications
	are tolerant of a fast application of the correction, while other
	applications prefer to "smear" the leap second over a longer period,
	where the time reported by leap-second aware servers is gradually
	applied so there is no major disruption to time synchronization
	during the processing a leap second.</t>

      <t>While leap second processing can be expected to be properly handled
	by up-to-date software and by time servers, there are large numbers
	of out-of-date software installations and client systems that are
	just not able to properly handle a leap second correction.</t>

      <t>This proposal offers a way for a system to generate a REFID that
	indicates that the time being supplied in the NTP packet already
	contains an amount of leap smear correction, and what that amount
	is.</t>

      <t>This format provides coverage for 136 years' time to a precision of
	232 picoseconds.  If a leap-second addition is being completely
	smeared just before before the stroke of the next POSIX second then
	the smear correction will be (0,1).  If this was the only way to apply
	a leap smear correction then we could simply use an unsigned value to
	represent the correction.  But while the first popular leap smear
	implementation applied the correction over an appropriate number of
	hours' time before the actual leap second so the system time was
	corrected at the stroke of 00:00, that meant that the difference
	between system time and UTC spent half of the duration of the smear
	application at [.5,1) "off" of correct time.  The second popular
	implementation of the leap smear applied the first half-second
	correction before the stroke of 00:00 for a correction range of
	(0,.5] and the last half-second correction starting at the stroke of
	00:00 for a [-.5,0) correction range.  This also means we need a
	signed value to represent the amount of correction.</t>

      <t>If a system implements the leap-smear REFID, the REFID of a system
	that is supplying smeared time to client requests while leap-smear
	correction is active would be 254.b1.b2.b3, where the three octets
	(b1, b2, and b3) are a 2:22 formatted value, yielding precision to 238
	nanoseconds, or about a quarter of a microsecond.</t>

      <t>Note that if an NTP server decides to offer smeared time
	corrections to clients, it SHOULD only offer this time in response to
	CLIENT time requests.  There is something to be said for further only
	offering smeared time to CLIENT time requests that show an LI value of
	0, and perhaps 3.  The reason for this is that if a client knows a
	leap second is pending, it can be expected to know how to process that
	leap second.  An NTP server that is offering smeared time SHOULD NOT
	send smeared time in any peer exchanges.  Also, CLIENT machines SHOULD
	not be distributing time (smeared or otherwise) to other systems.</t>

      <t>We also note that during the application of a leap smear, the REFID
	from a system offering smeared time cannot provide detection of a
	timing loop.  This is not expected to be a problem because time server
	systems are not expected to make CLIENT connections with each other,
	so they should not be receiving smeared time.  Moreso, if a time
	server is configured to make CLIENT connections to a server that
	offers smeared time, with the mechanism described here it can detect
	when it is getting smeared time, and either ignore time from that
	source, or "undo" the leap smear correction and use the corrected time
	for that sample.</t>

      <t>This proposal is not an attempt to justify servers offering leap
	smeared time.  Its purpose is to make it easy to identify when a
	client is receiving smeared time, and provide the client a way to
	know the amount of smear correction as of the latest successful
	poll.</t>
